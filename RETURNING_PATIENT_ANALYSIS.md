## 📈 **PATIENT HISTORY DATA ARCHITECTURE**

### ✅ **DATABASE DESIGN FOR HISTORICAL RECORDS:**

**🗂️ CORE PATIENT DATA (`patients` table):**
```sql
- id (Primary Key) - NEVER changes for returning patients
- first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
- phone, email, address
- emergency_contact information
- created_at (first registration date)
- updated_at (last profile update)
```

**📋 CONSULTATION HISTORY (`consultations` table):**
```sql
- Multiple records per patient_id
- Each visit creates new consultation record
- Stores: main_complaint, examination findings
- Records: preliminary_diagnosis, final_diagnosis
- Tracks: lab_investigation, prescription, treatment_plan
- Links: doctor_id, appointment_date
```

**🧪 LAB RESULTS HISTORY (`lab_results` table):**
```sql
- All lab tests linked to consultation_id
- Historical lab values for trend analysis
- Test comparison across visits
- Technician tracking for quality control
```

**💰 PAYMENT HISTORY (`step_payments` table):**
```sql
