feat: improve patients mobile UX and add lab results index route

- Replace cramped patients table on small screens with a dedicated mobile card layout and improve overall responsiveness and touch usability for the doctor's patients page.
  - Add mobile-first card styles, touch-target sizing, and progressive breakpoints in `assets/css/input.css`.
  - Hide the desktop table on small screens and render stacked, readable patient cards in `views/doctor/patients.php`.
  - Improve header/search button responsiveness and enlarge action button targets (min-height 44px).
  - Keep desktop/tablet table view for md+ breakpoints.

- Fix navigation/404 for lab results index by adding a controller action:
  - Add `DoctorController::lab_results()` to serve `/doctor/lab_results`, query recent lab results for patients that belong to the logged-in doctor, and render `views/doctor/lab_results.php`.

- Stability fixes:
  - Ensure safe DOB handling and fallbacks (avoid passing null to strtotime/date_create) so PHP deprecated warnings are avoided.

Files changed:
- assets/css/input.css
- views/doctor/patients.php
- controllers/DoctorController.php

Test notes:
- Validate My Patients page on desktop and mobile.
- Visit /doctor/lab_results to confirm no 404 and see results.
- Check PHP logs for no DOB-related warnings.
