### 3. Controller Changes

#### Added `payment_history()` Method to ReceptionistController

**Location:** `controllers/ReceptionistController.php`

**Functionality:**
```php
public function payment_history()
{
    // Build WHERE clause based on filters
    $where_clauses = ["p.payment_status = 'paid'"];
    $params = [];

    // Search by patient name
    if (!empty($_GET['search'])) {
        $where_clauses[] = "(pt.first_name LIKE ? OR pt.last_name LIKE ?)";
        $search_term = '%' . $_GET['search'] . '%';
        $params[] = $search_term;
        $params[] = $search_term;
    }

    // Filter by payment type
    if (!empty($_GET['payment_type'])) {
        $where_clauses[] = "p.payment_type = ?";
        $params[] = $_GET['payment_type'];
    }

    // Filter by payment method
    if (!empty($_GET['payment_method'])) {
        $where_clauses[] = "p.payment_method = ?";
        $params[] = $_GET['payment_method'];
    }

    // Build and execute query
    // Render payment_history view
}
```

**Features:**
- Dynamic WHERE clause building
- Support for multiple filter combinations
- Orders by payment_date DESC (newest first)
- Fetches only paid payments

### 4. Navigation Updates

#### Sidebar Menu (`views/layouts/main.php`)

**Before:**
```php
['url' => 'receptionist/payments', 'icon' => 'fas fa-credit-card', 'text' => 'Payments', 'badge' => '', 'color' => 'purple']
```

**After:**
```php
['url' => 'receptionist/payments', 'icon' => 'fas fa-exclamation-circle', 'text' => 'Pending Payments', 'badge' => '', 'color' => 'red'],
['url' => 'receptionist/payment_history', 'icon' => 'fas fa-history', 'text' => 'Payment History', 'badge' => '', 'color' => 'purple']
```

**Changes:**
- Split into two menu items
- "Pending Payments" - Red icon (exclamation circle)
- "Payment History" - Purple icon (history)

    pt.first_name,
    pt.last_name,
    pt.registration_number,
    pv.visit_date,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT lt.test_name SEPARATOR ', ') as test_names,
    SUM(lt.price) as total_amount
FROM lab_test_orders lto
JOIN patients pt ON lto.patient_id = pt.id
JOIN patient_visits pv ON lto.visit_id = pv.id
JOIN lab_tests lt ON lto.test_id = lt.id
LEFT JOIN payments pay ON pay.visit_id = pv.id 
    AND pay.payment_type = 'lab_test' 
    AND pay.payment_status = 'paid'
WHERE pay.id IS NULL
GROUP BY lto.patient_id, pv.id
```

### Pending Medicine Payments
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    pr.patient_id,
    pv.id as visit_id,
    pt.first_name,
    pt.last_name,
    pt.registration_number,
    pv.visit_date,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT m.name SEPARATOR ', ') as medicine_names,
    SUM(m.unit_price * pr.quantity_prescribed) as total_amount
FROM prescriptions pr
JOIN patients pt ON pr.patient_id = pt.id
JOIN consultations c ON pr.consultation_id = c.id
JOIN patient_visits pv ON c.visit_id = pv.id
JOIN medicines m ON pr.medicine_id = m.id
LEFT JOIN payments pay ON pay.visit_id = pv.id 
    AND pay.payment_type = 'medicine' 
    AND pay.payment_status = 'paid'
WHERE pay.id IS NULL
GROUP BY pr.patient_id, pv.id
```

### Payment History (Filtered)
```sql
SELECT p.*, 
       CONCAT(pt.first_name, ' ', pt.last_name) as patient_name,
       pv.visit_date
FROM payments p
JOIN patients pt ON p.patient_id = pt.id
LEFT JOIN patient_visits pv ON p.visit_id = pv.id
WHERE p.payment_status = 'paid'
  [AND additional filters]
ORDER BY p.payment_date DESC
```

## Workflow Impact

### Before Redesign
1. Receptionist opens "Payments" page
2. Sees mixed list of pending and recorded payments
3. Must scan through table to find pending items
4. Scrolls past payment history to find action items

### After Redesign
1. Receptionist opens "Pending Payments" page
2. Immediately sees only items requiring action
3. Clear visual separation (red for labs, orange for medicines)
4. Quick access to "Record Payment" buttons
5. Optional: Navigate to "Payment History" for past transactions

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions:
1. **Export Functionality**
   - Export payment history to Excel/PDF
   - Date range selection for exports

2. **Bulk Payment Processing**
   - Select multiple pending payments
   - Process in single transaction

3. **Payment Analytics**
   - Daily/weekly/monthly revenue charts
   - Payment method distribution
   - Popular services analysis

4. **Notifications**
   - Alert when pending payments > threshold
   - End-of-day payment summary email

5. **Receipt Printing**
   - Implement print_receipt functionality
   - Customizable receipt templates

6. **Payment Details Modal**
   - Implement viewPayment() function
   - Show full payment breakdown
   - Display related test results or prescriptions
